# Ruble_Volatility_Prediction
Time series forecasting of Russian currency volatility using macroeconomic indicators

## üìä Ruble Volatility Prediction Project

This repository explores the long-term volatility of the Russian ruble (RUB ‚ÇΩ) using macroeconomic and geopolitical data from 1992 to 2025. 
The project includes:

- Data cleaning and preparation of historical exchange rate and macro indicators.
- Normalization across currency denomination change in 1998.
- Exploratory visualizations and correlation analysis.
- Forecasting using ARIMA, ARIMAX, and GARCH models.
- Causal inference (e.g., synthetic control, event studies) around major political/economic shocks.
